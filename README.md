## Grand Project

## Grand Project: Credit Risk Analysis for Loan Approval

The grand project undertaken during the bootcamp was to predict the best algorithm for credit risk analysis for loan approval. The objective of this project was to develop a predictive model that can accurately assess the credit risk associated with loan applicants, aiding financial institutions in making informed decisions regarding loan approvals. The project involved:
- Data collection and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model training and evaluation
- Selection of the best-performing algorithm based on performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

The insights gained from this project are invaluable for understanding the efficacy of different machine learning algorithms in the domain of credit risk analysis and have significant implications for the financial industry.
